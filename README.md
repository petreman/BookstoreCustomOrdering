# BookstoreCustomOrdering: The U of A Bookstore Hoodie Order Tool
AUCSC 320 Winter 2020 3-Week Project.

This is the first "real life" project I've ever worked on. 

## The Problem
The University of Alberta's North Campus bookstore wanted a web-app developed that would allow workers to enter information about what a student wants on their hoodies. 
Customizations will be in specific, predetermined locations (e.g. faculty on the chest, name on the arm, etc.).
A file with the necessary information for customizations would be created when finished, which can then be sent directly to the hoodie embroiderer. 
Manually writing down what is wanted in a form would no longer be necessary because of this app.

## Development
The app itself is a web-app, packaged for use on desktops through [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). 
This was a big deal for me, as at the time I did not know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and the project had to be started and finished
in less than 3 weeks. I managed to pull through, and this project was an immense learning experience for me. I definitely understand
and enjoy working in an agile environment now!

The order data entered in the app is stored on a Google Sheet, which is hardcoded into the app due to time constraints. 
I have removed the U of A's Sheet from the code and have instead set it up to a test sheet that anyone can try without causing issues.

## Special Thanks
Thank you to my more experienced team members, who helped me learn and grow through development, the instructors of the course for giving
me and many others such awesome opportunities to show others what we can do, and for the U of A bookstore for giving us a chance! This was definitely
an experience I'll never forget.
